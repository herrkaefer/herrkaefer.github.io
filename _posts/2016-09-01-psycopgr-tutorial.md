## What is psycopgr

psycopgr [<i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/herrkaefer/psycopgr) is a Python wrapper of [pgRouting](http://pgrouting.org/) written by me.

As said in [pgRouting docs](http://workshop.pgrouting.org/2.1.0-dev/en/chapters/wrapper.html):

Indeed, in many applicatons you may need to modify the database tables and fill some computed values to fit your specific purpose, which is often done in a preprocessing stage by SQL, before real routing starts working. It is not appropriate to be wrapped.

However, after preprocessing things such as database creation, map data import, tables re-calculation and update, you are ready to use `psycopgr` to do another simple thing: **computing optimal routes from nodes to nodes on real map, in Python.**

Note that `psycopgr` is never a general purpose wrapper of pgRouting. I am a novice in GIS and what I want from this tool is just routes (with lowest costs) from places to places without writing a single line of SQL. 

For preprocessing stage, I have a post ["pgRouting notes"](/2016/08/30/pgrouting-notes/) for my own reference. Before enjoyable Python coding, you have to prepare a few stuffs.

## Tutorial

### Requirements

1. Prepare a PostgreSQL database, install PostGIS and pgRouting extensions, and import map data to database. ["pgRouting notes"](/2016/08/30/pgrouting-notes/) is a practical guide.

2. Update database tables according to your specific requirement. 

### Install psycopgr

```sh
pip install psycopgr
```
(Yes, it is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/psycopgr/) now.)

Or, 

```sh
pipenv install psycopgr
```

As you may guessed from the name, `psycopgr` uses `psycopg2` as PostgreSQL driver. The above command will install it automatically.

### Steps

First, 

```python
from psycopgr import PgrNode, PGRouting
```

Create an PGRouting instance with database connection:

```python
pgr = PGRouting(database='mydb', user='user')
```

Adjust meta datas of tables including the edge table properies if they are different from the default (only the different properties needs to be set), e.g.:

```python
pgr.set_meta_data(cost='cost_s', reverse_cost='reverse_cost_s', directed=true)
```

This is the default meta datas:

```python
{
    'table': 'ways',
    'id': 'gid',
    'source': 'source',
    'target': 'target',
    'cost': 'cost_s', # driving time in second
    'reverse_cost': 'reverse_cost_s', # reverse driving time in second
    'x1': 'x1',
    'y1': 'y1',
    'x2': 'x2',
    'y2': 'y2',
    'geometry': 'the_geom',
    'has_reverse_cost': True,
    'directed': True,
    'srid': 4326
}
```

Prepare nodes. nodes are represented by `PgrNode` namedtuple with geographic coordinates rather than vertex id (vid) in the tables. `PgrNodes` is defined as:

```python
PgrNode = namedtuple('PgrNode', ['id', 'lon', 'lat'])
```

in which `id` could be `None` or self-defined value, and `lon` and `lat` are double precision values. Of course nodes could be input from various interfaces such as database or another program.

For example:

```python
nodes = [PgrNode(None, 116.30150, 40.05500),
         PgrNode(None, 116.36577, 40.00253),
         PgrNode(None, 116.30560, 39.95458),
         PgrNode(None, 116.46806, 39.99857)]
```

Now we can do routings:

```python
# many-to-many
routings = pgr.get_routes(nodes, nodes, end_speed=5.0, pgx_file='r.pgx')
# one-to-one
routings = pgr.get_routes(nodes[0], nodes[1])
# one-to-many
routings = pgr.get_routes(nodes[0], nodes)
# many-to-one
routings = pgr.get_routes(nodes, node[2])
```

- `end_speed`: speed from node to nearest vertices on ways in unit km/h.
- `gpx_file`: set it to output paths to a gpx file.

The returned is a dict of dict: `{(start_node, end_node): {'path': [PgrNode], 'cost': cost}`

By default, `cost` is traveling time along the path in unit second. It depends on the means of columns of the edge table that you set as `cost` and `reverse_cost`. You can assign the relations by `set_meta_data` function.

We can also get only costs without detailed paths returned:

```python
costs = pgr.get_costs(nodes, nodes)
```
The returned is also a dict: `{(start_node, end_node): cost}`


## Low-level wrapper of pgRouting functions

| psycopgr function | pgRouting function |
| :---------------- | :----------------- |
| dijkstra          | pgr_dijkstra       |
| dijkstra_cost     | pgr_dijkstraCost   |
| astar             | pgr_astar          |


These are direct wrappings of pgRouting functions. For example, `dijkstra` takes vertex ids as input. This list may be extended in the future.
